# NavigationExperimental

A new Navigation system for react native. Focuses on the following improvements over `<Navigator />`:

- Single-directional data flow, using reducers to manipulate top-level state object
- Navigation logic and routing must be independent from view logic to allow for a variety of native and js-based navigation views
- Improved modularity of scene animations, gestures, and navigation bars

If you're confused about all the navigation options, look at the [Navigation Comparison](Docs/NavigationOverview.md) doc.
